# Superstore-Sales-Dashboard
With growing demands and cut-throat competition in the market, the store is seeking knowledge in understanding what works best for them. They would like to understand which products, regions, categories, and customer segments they should target or avoid.
Exploratory Analysis was performed in order to identify the quality of data such as identifying and excluding missing values, removing outliers, creating new variables from existing columns and converting the data types of variables as needed.Additional manipulation of data includes converting the sales and profit columns(represented as text ) into numerical columns and converting such columns as order date and ship date, that is (column C & D) into date fields as well.
The Result:
The dataset used for this analysis contains **9,995** records and **21** variables. There were seven missing values which were excluded from the analysis due to the fact they accounted for less than **0.1%** of the total dataset and would have no significant impact on the overall data.

The funnel chart shows that the **consumer** **segment** generated more profit than the **corporate** and **Home office** category. This is because **52%** of the client population belong to this category and majority of the products sold are bought by customers in this category. 
Further analysis shows that majority of the products sold by this company are tailored towards this category (accessories, phones, furnishings etc) and customers tend to buy more than the other categories.

The **Canon imageCLAS**S product which belongs to the Technology class is driving more sales and profit than any other product although it is not the product with the highest quantity being sold.

California, New York, Washington, Michgan, Indiana and Georgia are the top six states that are generating profit. These 6 states have the highest number of customers, quantity of product sold and sales.

States like Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania are running at a loss even with high number of customers and large number of products being sold. This could be that a large of number of products generating little profit are being sold more and customers in this states are not buying expensive products.

March 18th, 2014 had the highest sales ($28,106.716) and highest Profit (8,738.80) was generated in October 2nd, 2016. The least profit was generated in November 25th, 2016.

The phone subcategory has the highest sales and a large number of quantities being sold but subcategories like copiers generated more profit even when the quantities sold are just few.

**Subcategories** like tables, bookcases etc. generated more sales with no profit to the company. This could be that these products have been discounted and are being sold below cost price.
